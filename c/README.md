C

Unlike the other language directories, this one doesn't have any demonstration
programs.


Disclaimer
----------

I don't encourage people in my lab to program in C. If your project requires a
compiled language, I prefer that you write it in Go. That said, if you want to
learn C for the sake of learning C, I'm all for it.


Resources
---------

If you've set your mind on learning C, there are a few resources in the lab
that may be useful to you.

Note that my particular style of C is something that I half made up myself.
It's based on two principles: (1) most everything is a pointer to a struct, and
(2) you don't need any more data structures than a vector and map. My C is not
standard C, and for that reason, I don't really approve of it. Instead of
following my example, you may be better off learning from the hundreds of C
resources available online.

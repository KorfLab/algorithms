C

Unlike the other language directories, this one doesn't have any demonstration
programs.


Disclaimer
----------

I don't encourage people in my lab to program in C (or C++, C#, Java, Rust,
etc.). If you want something faster than Python, I would rather you program in
Go.


Resources
---------

If you've set you eyes on learning C, there are a few resources in the lab that
may be useful to you.

Note that my particular style of C is something that I made up myself. It's
based on two principles: (1) everything is a pointer to a struct, and (2) every
language ought to have arrays and maps built in. My C is not standard C, and
for that reason, I don't really approve of it. Instead of following my example,
you may be better off learning from the hundreds of C resources available
online.
